# Archaic_introgression_in_PNG

## Study overview
<p>Functional characterisation of Denisovan and Neandertal archaic SNPs segregating within PNG, initially identified by Jacobs et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.035). <p>

<p>In this study we took advantage of the Roadmap Epigenomics data to characterise the impact of archaic variants across multiple cells and chromatin states. We then assessed the function of regulatory variation on transcription factor binding affinities and their putative correlation to observalble phenotypic differences across Island Southeast Asia.<p>
